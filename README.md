This Python script is designed to convert from multiple CBR or CBZ files to a full PDF with all the joined data. For example, is common if you download a Superhero comic that was originally published in little stapled comics, all the whole history will be splitted into differnt CBR files

However, normally it is more helpful to have the full PDF in order to read directly a single PDF doc. 

This script allows to translate from all this CBR and CBZ files to a full PDF file with all following the order.

USAGE is just add all the CBR and CBZ files into the same directory than the script and launch the script. It is designed for Windows, so running in Unix-like systems is not currently supported
